# Python Documentation Example Codes

This repo aims to go through the Python documentation (`Tutorial.pdf`) and provide some practical examples to the
features Python provides.

The examples are based on *Python Release 3.12.1*, using the *February 02, 2024* edition of the tutorial.

## Tips

It is recommended to run the code in debugging mode, especially in case of longer code snippets,
since it is hard to overview which output belongs where, if the code is run all at once, especially in case of longer files.
